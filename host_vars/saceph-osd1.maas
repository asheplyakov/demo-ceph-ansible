# sometimes ansible fails with empty yaml files, so define a variable here
dummy:

# Normally the inventory script sets the data and journal devices according
# to the storage tags. One can override them here on a per host basis:

# devices:
#   - /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD20EURS-63SPKY0_WD-WMC300967502
#   - /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST1000DM003-1CH162_S1DGTCYM

# Note: the same drive is listed twice, there will be two journal
# partitions (one per a drive specified above)

# raw_journal_devices:
#   - /dev/disk/by-id/ata-INTEL_SSDSC2BP240G4_BTJR529502MY240AGN
#   - /dev/disk/by-id/ata-INTEL_SSDSC2BP240G4_BTJR529502MY240AGN
